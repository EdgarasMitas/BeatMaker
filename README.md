# BeatMaker
Finished beatmaker using HTML,CSS and vanilla JS. At first built using tutorials, later built by myself using my notes and the occasional glance at tutorials.Â I have really enjoyed working on this and make it play sounds. There were a couple of parts that were unclear with updateBtn and uses of this., but eventually I figured it out.What I have learned:Classes,constructors,this. and objects,methods,loops,callback functions,call stack,global execution context,prototypes etc.
